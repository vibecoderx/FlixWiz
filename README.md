## üöÄ Tech Stack

FlixWiz is built with the latest Apple technologies and leverages some of the best entertainment data APIs available:

* **SwiftUI**: The entire user interface is built declaratively with SwiftUI, ensuring a modern and responsive design.
* **APIs**:
    * **The Movie Database (TMDB)**: For trending movies and TV shows, as well as detailed information and images.
    * **OMDb API**: For comprehensive movie and TV show data, including ratings from various sources.
    * **Watchmode**: To provide up-to-date information on where to watch content across various streaming services.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

To get the FlixWiz project up and running on your local machine, follow these simple steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/vibecoderx/FlixWiz.git
    cd FlixWiz/ios
    ```
2.  **Open the project in Xcode:**
    ```bash
    open FlixWiz.xcodeproj
    ```
3.  **Set up your API Keys:**
    FlixWiz requires API keys from TMDB, OMDb, and Watchmode to function correctly. These are managed using an `Secrets.xcconfig` file.
    * In the `FlixWiz/ios` directory, create a new file named `Secrets.xcconfig`.
    * Add your API keys to this file in the following format:

        ```
        TMDB_API_KEY = YOUR_TMDB_API_KEY
        OMDB_API_KEY = YOUR_OMDB_API_KEY
        WATCHMODE_API_KEY = YOUR_WATCHMODE_API_KEY
        ```

4.  **Build and Run:**
    Select your target device or simulator in Xcode and press `Cmd+R` to build and run the application.

> ### **A Note on How This App Was Built**
>     
> A significant portion of the code in this repository was generated with the assistance of a large language model (LLM). This project was largely **"vibe-coded,"** meaning it was developed through a rapid, iterative, and conversational process with a GenAI tool with minimal review of the generated code. Correctness of the code was checked at certain core places (e.g., using the correct API endpoints, etc). Overall app correctness check was done via manual testing of various UI workflows.
